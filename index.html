                GUIDE Coordinating the details leading to a successful event can be stressful, and we bring attention to detail, care and hospitality to you throughout the process. Our goal is to create a unique and memorable event, tailored to your needs.
                Whether you would like to entertain a select group of clients, host a large reception throughout the entire restaurant or bring the Per Se experience into your home, we offer a number of possibilities. EAST ROOM The East Room seats as
                many as 11 guests and offers stunning views of the Manhattan skyline and Central Park. A glass panel, adorned with silk drapes for total privacy, overlooks the restaurant's main dining room. Guests of the East Room enjoy a unique tasting
                menu, based on the freshest ingredients available to our chefs on the day of the special event. Reservations for The East Room at Per Se can be made exclusively on our website for all dates through March 31, 2019. We will release two months
                of reservations on the first day of every even-numbered month. The next release will occur on Februaryt 1st for dates from April 1st through May 31st. WEST ROOM The West Room accommodates up to 66 guests for seated events or 120 guests
                for standing receptions. The room was designed to offer an elegant space reminiscent of a Parisian living room. The cream colored walls, horizontal mirrors in linear formations and mahogany furniture provide a soothing backdrop to any
                occasion. Audio-visual features are available. The room offers its own guest lobby area and private restrooms. MAIN DINING ROOM We offer the possibility of exclusive use of the restaurant for lunch or dinner. For larger parties, consider
                Per Se's main dining room, which overlooks Central Park, or expand the use of the restaurant to all our private dining rooms for larger functions. Our salon area offers the perfect location for your pre-event standing reception. OFFSITE
                EVENTS For intimate dinner parties at home or other locations of your choice, we bring our chefs and service team to you, offering an opportunity to experience the restaurant virtually anywhere. Please note that due to the number of dedicated
                Per Se kitchen and service staff we will reserve for your offsite event, advance notice is required. Our private dining team will work closely with you to customize a menu for your event. The menu is designed around your personal preference
